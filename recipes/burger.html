    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I have loved burgers for as long as I can remember, I am american after all!
        For the longest time I considered burgers to be a pretty simple food. However, one 
        christmas I received a Bob's Burgers cookbook from my parents - and ever since then
        I have been experimenting making all sorts of wild and delicious burger recipes.
        However there's still something to be said about a simple no frills burger, and that's
        exactly what this is.
